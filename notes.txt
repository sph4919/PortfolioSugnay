#units in css
px (pixal) , 100%(percentage) , vw(Viewwidth) , vh(viewHeight)

#position
-Static Positioning
Static is the default value for the position attribute. It specifies that the element should be placed where the HTML and CSS naturally dictate. As a result, the specifications of top and left have no effect if the position attribute is set to static.

-Relative Positioning
Relative positioning adjusts the positioning in relation to where the element would have normally been placed by the browser. If left and top have no values, this has no effect.

-For position:absolute, the frame of reference is either the page itself, or the upper-left corner of an enclosing element if it is also absolutely positioned.
